# Simple example to demonstrate C++ basic project setup

This C++ project was written in addition to
[this blogpost](https://victormarinsky.com/), which describes how important good
project setup is.
This repository has a simple "business-logic" file. It sets warning level to
maximum, uses code style analyzer and unit tests, all of which were configured
from the very beginning (before writing any code).
